# DesktopGameSnake

Hello!
This is my second project on my way to be a developer :)
It is classic game Snake, where i added some new ideas:
- the snake eat not only fruits, but coins (more score);
- if the snake has collision with a stump, player will lose a life;
- snail reduces speed
- scissors cuts the snake tail
- and etc

More you can find in the game menu "Game Rules"

Also the game has 2 Players mode. The goal is to eat more fruits first. The progress of the tail length of each player is displayed above the playing field.

Most of the graphics i created by myself (snake, grass, rainbow, clouds). I took sounds from free sources = 2 from Mario :)

Important!
To compile, in the "Res" folder your must put there this 3 folders https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_XwlqYy2uuOajJBQVVwSHlkSW8
