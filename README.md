# DesktopGameSnake

Hello!

It is classic game Snake, where i added some new ideas:
- the snake eat not only fruit, but coins (more score);
- if the snake has collision with a stump, player will lose a life;
- snail reduces speed
- scissors cuts the snake tail
- and etc

More information you can find out in the game menu "Game Rules"

In 1 Player mode the goal is to earn more score by eating fruit and collecting coins. 

Also the game has 2 Players mode. The goal is to eat more fruit first. Each player's progress is displayed in the form of a growing snake and finish line that they need to achieve.

Most of the graphics i created by myself (snake, grass, rainbow, clouds). I took the sounds from free sources. 2 from Mario game :)
